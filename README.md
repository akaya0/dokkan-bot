# Dokkan EZA Bot
![ddmugb2-b79a8d4f-76ba-4005-8e20-4650b661b134](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f0395c8-05c8-44b0-b617-561ac1bd2d50)

This program connects to an Android device using ADB (Android Debug Bridge), captures screenshots, and processes these images using OpenCV. It includes functionalities for image matching and type/depth consistency checks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- adbutils
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

## Installation

1. Install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install ADB on your system. Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) to set it up.
3. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dokkan-bot.git
    cd dokkan-bot
    ```
4. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python-headless numpy adbutils
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure your Android device is connected to your computer with USB debugging enabled.
2. Choose the EZA to farm
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Device not found**: Ensure that your device is connected and USB debugging is enabled. Run `adb devices` to check if your device is listed.
- **Templates not found on Screen**: Even though there are error checks your device might need their own screenshots taken, replace templates accordingly.
- **Virtual Environment** I strongly advice using conda/venv, because i got no clue what im actually doing. ü´°‚ù§Ô∏è

## To-Do

- **Difficulty Selection** I think it's fine as is to just farm infinitely, but I definitely need to add difficulty selection for coin farming
- **Story Mode**: Self-explanatory
- **Tournament**: I think the most important one is to add a tournament support, I mean at a normal rate there's no way to beat it otherwise?!
